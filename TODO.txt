// - increase DoF resolution
// - further gaussian blur of high-res DoF targets to approximate intended degree of sharpness
// - screen-space ambient occlusion using existing z data (rendertexture #3 after first pass!)
// - integrate FXAA/SMAA (on framebuffer, pre-HUD, ~step 79-81)
//- HUD toggle
//	+ DrawIndexedPrimitiveUP for all non-text graphics
//	+ DrawPrimitiveUp for text
// - fix the disappearing sun/moon issue (well, first find out what's causing it)
	+ NOTE: only happens for vertical res > 720
	+ Mostly fixed: Certain resolution/setting combinations still have issues though.
// - improve performance with changed HUD (hit should be negligible, why isn't it?)
- improve SSAO quality / support alternative implementations
- variable rendering resolution (hysteresis thresholding, drop res when hitting ~ >30 ms frame time)
// - fix window shrink after toggling borderless fullscreen multiple times
- minimize/move initial loading window
- efficiently reuse buffers when multiple effects are used
- fix sporadic SMAA issue reported (first need to reproduce)
// - look into problems reported with save backup system
- figure out where / when / how projection matrix is set (for aspect ratio fix and to know exact nearZ/farZ)
// - prefix checksums with 0
// - fix text cutoff at 1024x720
// - fix dynamic shadow cutoff
- turn off SSAO when activating bonfire
- make individual parts of HUD scale separately
- save management with more than 1 GFWL/Steam account

HUD
___
- separate scaling factors for different parts of the HUD
- Bugs:
  + boss health bars
  + switching indicator (for weapons/spells/items) not scaled
  + curse symbol not scaled
  + subtitles
  + interaction with sun/moon
  + damage numbers
  + black boxes appearing semi-opaque under certain events
  
Cleanup
_______
- move Effect compilation to base class, with nice wrapper for setting defines
- split texture handling part of renderstate manager into separate texture manager
- create some kind of generic interface for the detection of different positions in the renderpipeling, use in renderstate manager
